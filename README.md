This project was a college project which was completed as course work and may be further developed in order to create a more optimised and high quality system. 
This project uses an SQL database in order to show an employee overview and has a calendar which was developed inside the system. 
This project is develop on WinForms .NET 4.7.2 however I may rewrite it all in a more up-to-date framework such as 6.0 or 7.0.

Feel free to download this and use it to learn as I struggled to find a way to create a working calendar based system anywhere.

Please note you will need to hook up your own database otherwise this will not work!
