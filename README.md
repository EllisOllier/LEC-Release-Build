This project was a college project which was completed as course work and may be further developed in order to create a more optimised and high quality system. 
This project uses an SQL database in order to show an employee overview and has a calendar which was developed inside the system. 
This project is developed on WinForms .NET 4.7.2 however I may rewrite it all in a more up-to-date way by using Xamarin or WPF as they have many more features when it comes to creating and customising the front end of an application.

Feel free to download this and use it to learn as I struggled to find a way to create a working calendar based system anywhere.

Please note you will need to hook up your own database otherwise this will not work!
